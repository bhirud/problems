// https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/
// Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

// For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

public class Solution {
    public int HIndex(int[] citations) {
        int max = 0;
        Array.Sort(citations);
        for(int i =0; i< citations.Length; i++)
        {
                max = Math.Max(max, Math.Min(citations[i], citations.Length - i));
        }
        return max;
    }
